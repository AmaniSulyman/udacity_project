    "## Introduction\n",
    "\"They're good dogs, Brent\" is one of 2016's most popular memes from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. This Twitter account awards stars to users' pets along with a hilarious comment.  the numerators (11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.) are virtually always bigger than 10. The rates should range from one to ten in theory. WeRateDogs disagrees, admitting that almost all dogs merit at least a 10, and often much more, stars. WeRateDogs has more than 6 million followers and has been featured in international media. \n",
